# Introduction

Let's discover **Lunox** in less than 5 minutes.

## Overview

Lunox is NodeJs framework that aims to bring Laravel features in NodeJs environtment. If you are not familier with Laravel, you can check the [website](https://laravel.com/). We will support all basic Laravel features, but we make it as simple as possible. We are not planning to make this framework complex like [adonis](https://adonisjs.com/) did.

## Why using Lunox Framework

Why choosing Lunox? This is some basic guide that helped you decide to use lunox.
1. Lunox is good if you want static typing and modern syntax of nodejs. Lunox is using ESM module and typescript by default.
2. Lunox is perfect for developer who like lighweight MVC framework. Lunox built in top of [polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka) as http server and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as frontend tooling.
3. Lunox is best for you if you love [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) too much. Yes, we are using svelte as template engine. Maybe next time we will support other javascript framework like react or vue.

## Prerequisites
For a better development experience, here is the recomended system requirements:
1. use pnpm as package manager 
2. use unix or unix like system, currently lunox cannot run on windows :cry:. Please reference this [issue](https://github.com/kodepintar/lunox/issues/14)
3. use nodejs  v14.x or more. v16.x (stable version) is recommended
